# Arcade Space Shooter

Hey there! This project is based on classic space shooter games that inspired me, like Galaga. 

A playable build wil be completed as soon as possible. It will be updated in the future when I have more time. 

Planned features include fluid movement, clean and appealing UI, and progressive difficulty. 

The game is built as an iOS app, and a web port via WebGL will be attempted. 

If you have any suggestions on things to add to this game, let me know!
