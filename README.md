# ArcadeSpaceShooter

Hey there! This project is based on classic space shooter games that inspired me such as Galaga. I plan on completing a playable build as soon as possible then will update it in the future when I have more time. My goal is to include fluid movement, a clean appealing UI and progressive difficulty. The game is built as an iOS app, however I will try to port it onto a website using WebGL. If you have any suggestions on things to add to this game, let me know!
