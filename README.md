# ArcadeSpaceShooter

Hey there! For this independent side project I will be creating a game based on my take of the classic space shooter genre. 
This game is inspired by the numerous arcade style games that I grew up playing. In order to recreate that addictive arcade 
aspect, I will try to keep the game mechanics as simple as possible while still retaining a necessary skill factor, aswell as 
have a clean appealing UI. 

This is mostly a side project for me so theres no strict deadline I must follow, however I hope to have this games first 
stable playable version completed by early December 2018. For the foreseable future, I plan on deploying this game to the 
iOS App store for iPhones. 

If you have any suggestions on some cool things to add to this game or want to co-develope this project with me just let me know! :)
